# Portfolio

A portfolio of projects I have undertaken over the last couple of years.

## Asset Management
This was a group project I took part in during 2018, to build an asset management system for AMRC Sheffield.The project focused on seeing a software
engineering project through from inception to completion. The presented solution won a competition against a number of other teams.

## CPP Web Provisioning For Arduino
This is one of my first pieces of C++. I wrote a piece of code which easily lets IoT programmers represent HTML using a tree-like data structure. 
Neighboring HTML tags are represented with a linked list and children are linked to parent nodes recursively. A parser function lets the programmer
assemble their HTML tree into a well formed string of HTML code.

## Document Retrieval System
A python assignement which tasked me with implementing text search algorithms in python using word vector representations. Implemented TF-IDF, TF and 
Binary weighting schemes and also allows for pre-processing techniques such as stemming and top-listing.

## Dominoes
This project involved the implementation of the game Dominoes in the functional language Haskell. This was maybe my favourite project. The contained
code also implements a basic AI or computer-player which a human can face off against.

## MyEtchAThing
This C++ project involved turning an ESP32 Microcontroller mounted with a touch-screen into an etch-a-sketch. The project uses a gyroscope to emulate 
the movement of dials on an etch-a-sketch so that the user can draw on the screen.

##OTA Update System
This is a C++ project which explores methods of performing over-the-air updates. The project aims to make OTA updates secure using encryption and
physical security features of the hardware, such as buttons and switches to verify an OTA update. The system also explores serving dynamic
web-pages on OTA devices using the web provisioning libraries I have attached above.

##Web Development - Children's Game
This is a website I created for an assignment. The brief was a website which sells children's educational games. The provided code implements a simple
game in JavaScript and a webpage for the hypothetical company.

## Other bits and pieces
* I'm working a lot on IoT devices at the moment so there will be more of that to show soon.
* My dissertation is WIP. I'm working on a data-driven classification system which uses lexical, syntactic and acoustic features to automatically distinguish between the speech of healthy people and people with dementia.
